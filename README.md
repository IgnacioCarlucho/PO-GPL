This is the code for our paper "[A General Learning Framework for Open Ad Hoc Teamwork
Using Graph-based Policy Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05448)". Inside you will find all the code and tutorials on how to run things.


# How to install and run   

We recommend installing conda and then creating an environment with python 3.7, you can do this as:
